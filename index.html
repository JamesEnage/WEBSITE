              <H3> In the future, I envision a life where I am both personally fulfilled and professionally accomplished. My journey as a working student has instilled in me a strong sense of discipline and resilience, values I intend to carry forward in building a stable and meaningful career. My ultimate goal is to establish a fulfilling career in my chosen field, one that allows me to continually learn, grow, and contribute meaningfully to both my organization and my community.

                My first priority is to complete my degree successfully, as I know that education is the foundation of future opportunities. After graduation, I plan to secure a role that not only matches my skills and interests but also allows me to apply what I’ve learned in real-world situations. With my existing experience as a working student, I believe I will have a unique advantage, already familiar with balancing responsibility, deadlines, and diverse tasks. I aim to find a position that values growth and development, where I can continue to learn from mentors and expand my skill set in practical and innovative ways.
                
                Financial stability is another cornerstone of my dream future. With my job, I hope to establish savings, contribute to my family’s well-being, and invest in further opportunities for myself, such as certifications or advanced training that will help me stay competitive in a constantly evolving industry. I am committed to building financial independence, not just to sustain my needs but also to support and give back to those who have supported me along the way.
                
                In the longer term, I aspire to hold a leadership role or work as a specialized expert in my field. I see myself taking on responsibilities that involve not only technical expertise but also mentoring others and making strategic decisions. To achieve this, I plan to continuously invest in my education, whether through advanced degrees or professional courses. I envision myself contributing to a forward-thinking team, where I can bring creative ideas to the table and work toward meaningful solutions that have a positive impact.
                
                Ultimately, my dream is to create a life where I can look back with pride, knowing that every challenge I overcame as a working student led to a future filled with purpose and opportunity. I am driven by the belief that hard work, continuous learning, and a commitment to growth will help me realize a future where my aspirations are not just dreams, but achievements.</H3>

                    <li>After facing financial struggles during the pandemic, I had to put my education on hold. Knowing how important education is, I was determined to return, even if it meant starting with back subjects. During my OJT, I was offered a position in the company, marking my journey as a working student. From that point, I decided to support myself to ease the burden on my family. Now, as a fourth-year student, I balance classes by day and work by night, driven by the goal of achieving my dreams and securing a better future through education.</li>
